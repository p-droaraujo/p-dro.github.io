# My Personal Website

This is my personal website and second brain on the internet ([p-dro.com](https://p-dro.com)) where I share my random thoughts, study notes, and dev logs for projects I’m tinkering with.  

I built this site to try out [Astro](https://astro.build) for the first time while tryingh to keep it very minimal and useful.

Design was heavily inspired by Steph Ango's at [Stephano](https://stephango.com/).

## Features

- Markdown based posts
- Clean, responsive design
- Easy deployment to GitHub Pages

## Setup

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Add your own Markdown posts (please don’t use mine).
4. Run locally: `npm run dev`
5. Build and deploy: `npm run build`
6. Check out [Astro’s GitHub Pages guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/) for deployment tips.

## Content Disclaimer

You’re free to fork, copy, or tweak this code however you want. The actual words (my posts, notes, etc.) are written by me, so if you want to use something, just reach me out.
